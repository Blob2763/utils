## ROADMAP
- Settings [IN PROGRESS]
- More tools:
    - Conversions
    - Timers
    - Generators

## DEV STUFF
When adding a new feature, duplicate a tool and make sure you change the following things:
- Title
- All instances of the tool name (usually in ALL CAPS)
- Add the tool to tools.js

If you're making a conversion:
- Add an entry to "data" in conversions.js and fill in all the info
- Add conversion code by editing the "base" functions
- Everything else should be done :)
